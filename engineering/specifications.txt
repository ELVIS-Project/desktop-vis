    Technical specifications for how we will meet our high-level objectives.


Implementation Specifications:
==============================
Imaginary User 1, the Double Domain Expert (DDE) will work at this level.

Targeted Libraries:
- python 2.7.5
- music21 1.6.0
- pandas 0.10.0
- R 3.0.1
- VisTrails 2.0 API
    http://www.vistrails.org/usersguide/v2.0/html/batch.html#finding-methods-via-the-command-line

Two Data Models:
- IndexedPiece:
    Stores, formats, and prepares data about a single piece.
- AggregatedPieces:
    Stores, formats, and prepares data generated by Experimenter submodules, aggregated across more than one IndexedPiece.

Two Analyzers (name?):
- Indexer:
    For things that make sense to imagine as starting at the beginning and ending at the end of a piece, like "notes" or "chords."
- Experimenter:
    For things that correspond to a piece, but not a particular moment in it, like "number of notes" and "contrapuntal entropy."

Two Controllers:
- WController (for VisTrails workflows):
    The model-view-adapter adapter component for the Web interface
- MPController (for multiprocessing):
    Easier way to coordinate and optimize our use of multiprocessing for any computationally-intense tasks.
    - must be accessible to all modules
    - shall be used whenever possible, for any computation
    - communication between MPController and client modules through Pipe
    - avoids the problem of making multiple Pool objects, resulting in a total of more processes than CPUs/cores available in the computer
    - avoids overhead of thinking how to use a Pool, and whether to use multiprocessing; just do it

Interface Specifications: VisTrails
===================================
Imaginary User 2, Invested Musicologist (IM) will work at this level.
- VisTrails docs must say how to write a new VisTrails module, connected to a vis thing

Targeted Libraries:
- VisTrails 2.0.2

Interface Specifications: HTML5
===============================
Imaginary User 3, Skeptical Musicologist (SM) will work at this level. It's a desktop web application, not meant for mobile devices.

Targeted Libraries:
- Django 1.5.1
- The database



- 10 trial queries
- imaginary users
