When You Commit to vis
======================

1.) To the fullest extent possible, include one task per commit. Avoid committing partially
    completed work or more than one task.

2.) Check modified lines for spelling mistakes.

3.) Run pylint on all modified files, using the "engineering/pylint_rc" rcfile:
>>> pylint --rcfile=engineering/pylint_rc modified_file.py

4.) Run all automated tests. If any tests fail, check that:
    - there is an issue on GitHub, or
    - there is a TODO in the "run_tests.py" file

5.) Commit.
