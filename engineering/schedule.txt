Jul-23:
    --> Class and Function Signatures and Documentation for Data Models, Analyzer Base Classes, and MPController
        This amounts to a non-working prototype for these components. The WController shall be left out for now.
    --> Proof-of-Concept for These Components
        To demonstrate our architecture can work as intended.

Jul-29:
    --> Full Implementation and Minimal Tests for These Components
        To demonstrate that all functionality works sometimes.
    --> Research visual design of Web interface

Aug-6:
    --> fall behind schedule

Aug-13:
    --> fall further behind schedule

Aug-21:
    --> even more schedule-busting

Aug-28:
    --> Indexer, Experimenter, IndexedPiece: fully implemented and tested (bare minimum number of indexers and experimenters)
    --> Aggregated Piece: base implementation; minimal tests
    --> base implementation of the Web interface (doesn't work, but it exists)
    --> base implementation of the new MPInterface-and-Multiprocessor implementation
    --> Alex has figured out how to use R, ggplot2, and Deducer

Sep-4:
    --> Web app development phase complete
    --> Begin documentation and integration testing (i.e., run real queries to see how to mess it up)
    --> Bridge to R

Sep-10: ??
    --> Prototype "Think Computationally with vis"
    --> Prototype "Use the vis Web App"
    --> Prototype "vis on VisTrails"
    --> Prototype "Extend vis on VisTrails"
    --> Write "Think Computationally with vis"
    --> Write "Use the vis Web App"
    --> Write "vis on VisTrails"
    --> Write "Extend vis on VisTrails"
    --> Write vis API
    --> Write vis Extensibility API
    --> Write VisTrails modules?
        --> Build sample workflows
