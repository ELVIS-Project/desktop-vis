Planning the Future:
====================

visX:
    - make IndexedPiece work throughout the four current controllers
    - Importer and Analyzer will do almost nothing, as most of their functionality gets drawn into
      IndexedPiece and Indexer subclasses
    - Importer is still responsible for connecting the GUI and IndexedPiece, and for checking that
      selected pathnames refer to actual files that appear to be of the correct type
    - Analyzer is still responsible for choosing all the complicated settings, but they'll just
      be stored for the Experimenter
    - Importer will also have to know which Indexer subclasses to run, for which we must adjust
      the GUI a little

vis11:
    - port our controllers to VisTrails modules
    - if possible, port the PyQt GUI to use those VisTrails modules; otherwise, at least ensure
      everything will work nicely for the HTML interface in vis13

vis12:
    - add visualizations through R
    - documentation for programmers

vis13:
    - add HTML5 interface (probably through Django)

vis14:
    - documentation for end users
